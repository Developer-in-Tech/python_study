# --- working with data types: numbers, strings, lists and tuples

string = "name" # items concatenated in double-qoute are reffered to ass string

numbers = 300 # numbers are just figure either with or without decimal point

lists = [10, balls, yellow, 450, 2.3] #list is a collection of ekements written in []

tuples = (ade, bola, 55, blue) # tuples are similar to list but are writtne in (), they cant be modified after initializing unlike lists that can be editted always




# --- mini project: write a python script to reverse a given string

script = "Hello World"
print(script[::-1])
