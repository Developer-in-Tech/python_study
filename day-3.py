string = "name" # items concatenated in double-qoute are reffered to ass string

numbers = 300 # numbers are just figure either with or without decimal point

color_list = ["blue", "yellow", "red"] # list is a collection of ekements written in []

ball_tuples = ("fred", "hakimi", "vini") # tuples are similar to list but are writtne in (), they cant be modified after initializing unlike lists that can be editted always




# --- mini project: write a python script to reverse a given string

script = "Hello World"
